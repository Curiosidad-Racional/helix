# Helix plugins system MVP

This is still an early alpha, you should expect frequent breaking changes.
The intend is to take inspiration from [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/).

Plugins for Helix are written in any language that can be compiled to WASM (Web Assembly).
This implies:
- No language language lock-in, user can use what they're most comfortable with to extend and customize their experience.
- Sandboxing, a plugin can do only what it has been allowed to.
- Portability, .wasm and .wat files are platform agnostic and can be packaged as is for any platform.

API is described by .witx files and bindings for some languages can be generated by [`witx-bindgen`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/witx-bindgen).
As of now, `witx-bindgen` is still in prototype stage.

Host side code is generated with [BLABLA TODO]
